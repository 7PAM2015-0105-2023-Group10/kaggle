In this project, we used different machine learning models to predict the Transported destination of the passengers in the Spaceship Titanic. We got  the dataset from the data science community sourced from Kaggle. This dataset captures information about passengers aboard a spaceship bound for destinations beyond our solar system.

Similar to the RMS Titanic, which tragically encountered disaster when it collided with an iceberg on its voyage and never reached New York, the Spaceship Titanic also faced an unforeseen eventâ€”a collision with a spacetime anomaly. This anomaly resulted in the transportation of certain passengers to an alternate dimension.

The Spaceship Titanic dataset includes records of passengers onboard, along with details indicating whether they were transported. The dataset is divided into two parts: the train dataset, which includes information about whether a passenger was transported (with the target column "transported"), and the test dataset, where the target column is absent.

Before training a model to predict the target column in the test dataset, several tasks must be performed on the dataset to gain deeper insights. These tasks include identifying patterns between the two classes, data cleaning, and determining the optimal approach for handling missing values in the dataset.
